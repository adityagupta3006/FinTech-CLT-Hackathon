A item lending mobile application is developed for a Carolina Fin Tech Hackathon.

The idea behind the application caters to bring the floating money in the market to the banks.

An item can be heavy machinery, a space or something very basic like lending your unused monitor to someone.


### Technologies
* Oracle Block Chain --> (https://www.oracle.com/cloud/blockchain/index.html) 
* Yodlee --> (https://www.yodlee.com/) Source for Financial Data.
* Oracle Mobile Cloud Platform (https://cloud.oracle.com/mobile)

### What do we mean by Floating Money?
The money stored in online accounts such as PayPal, PayTm, etc. keeps floating online from one person to another.
The bank transactions gets drastically reduced due to that.

### The Idea.
We start small, but aim big. 
There are millions of transactions happening, which go unaccounted by banks. 
Among such millions, there is a billion dollar industry whose transactions are unaccounted.
The item lending/renting business is the thing, which we focus on.

### Benefits

* Makes all transactions through the bank. (Increases bank involvement)
* Tracks item and sensory data. (Keeps a check on health of the item using IoT)
* Item History that one can trust. (Block Chain helps to find item history)
* Item Insurance (Keeps the item insured and generates income for the bank)
* In App logistics (Provides logisitics to transfer a item from one person to another. Creates more jobs)
